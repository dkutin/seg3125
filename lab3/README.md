# Requirements

- All the functional requirements of Laboratory 2.
- Additional choices/features for your two personas (from Activity 1).
- Words
    - Think about the choice of words you used in Lab 2. Take the time to evaluate those words. What words did you put on the buttons? What words did you use in the lists? In the instructions? Are those clear, non-ambiguous? Does a word chosen always mean the same thing in all places of the UI? Can you think of other words in your Alternative design this week?
    - For products, we sometimes say that an image is worth a thousand words ...
    - Consider adding images for the products sold, users may recognize an image better than a word. (optional)
    - Also watch out for spelling errors. Your site should not contain any errors. Have it reviewed by a relative or friend if you are unsure.
- Components (widgets)
    - Incorporate into your lab various components such as lists, radio buttons, check boxes. Modify the components that you had from lab 2. For example, replace a list with check boxes, or vice versa. Make sure that these are improvements to the UI, try not to change components just for the sake of building an alternative.
- Navigational patterns
    - Last week, the starting code had a navigation with the "Tab" which has a similar purpose as the card stack pattern we saw in the videos. That pattern structures the information in blocks, while leaving the user free to open one tab at a time in any order. Implement a different navigation pattern in this Lab 3 alternative (you can refer to the HOW-TO area of the W3schools tutorial for ideas).
- Structural patterns (optional: this will not lower or increase your grade)
- In lab 2, the product list was a simple list, without organization. You can add a categorization of products, namely: vegetables, fruits, dairy products, juice/beverages, cooking products (oil, spices etc.) etc. Choose the categorization you want and then, use a structural pattern to allow the user to see only one category such as only see the vegetables or only the fruits, etc. Use a structural pattern that you think is appropriate.
