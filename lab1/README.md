# Requirements

Your page must be aesthetically pleasing and have a certain style or uniformity that is consistent. We
will observe different design principles throughout the semester, so this will be your first attempt.
Your page should contain:

- A title (<title> tag)
- A link to the website of your choice (where the UI to be evaluated is)
- An image of the website you are evaluating which also serves as a link to the website.
- A form (<form> tag) containing at least 5 questions using the following types listed below:
    - A text type question (e.g. user must type in the answer)
    - A single choice question (radio button)
    - A single choice question (single selection list)
    - A multi-selection type question (several boxes can be selected)
    - A place to write comments.
    - A button to submit the questionnaire.
- Your signature (Website designed by ...) at the bottom of the page also known as a footer. It
does not need to be your real nameâ€¦ take an artist name!
- The use of divisions (<div> tag with associated CSS style) to make the questions uniform.
- Using external CSS (separate file) to define styles for titles, divisions, your signature at the
bottom of the page, etc. Explore styling for fonts, colors, alignments, etc.
