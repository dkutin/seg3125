# Requirements

## Visibility: Where am I? What can I do from here?
The following items must be present and easily visible. You have to think about how to organize the
information, and how to present it.
- Health clinic Information:
    - on which site the user is (logo, image, or company badge)
    - location (health service address)
    - the services offered and their prices (the user wouldn’t want bad surprises once at the clinic – include at least 5 services)
    - who are the experts? (the user wants to be confident and to know a little more about the experts working at the health clinic – describe at least 3 experts)
- Health clinic possible user actions:
    - Selection of a service
    - Selection of a date and time
    - Enter their contact information

## Consistency: The elements that I see are consistent within the page, and consistent with the standards that I know.
- Aesthetic consistency:
    - Decide on which elements in your page will create a consistent look.
    - Decide on the meaning of each font and color, in your page, to improve consistency.
    - Also, remember that "Fonts have moods". Bootstrap uses the Helvetica Neue font, but maybe it doesn't suit your business. Is it a fun easy-going health service provider or one that is more traditional and wants to offer a very classical look?

- Functional consistency
    - External
        - using standard Bootstrap components gives you this consistency of known functionality (lists, buttons)
        - use of standard navigation patterns
    - Internal
        - Bootstrap already suggests color choices to express different types of messages (success, warning, danger, etc. You can adapt these color choices to “fit” the style of site you want to show.
